# ATM System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to the ATM System project! This repository showcases the implementation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a programming language of your choice. 
The project provides a foundation for simulating an ATM system with features such as user authentication, balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, and transaction history. 
The main classes include "ATM," which manages ATM operations, "User," representing user accounts with account numbers and balances, and "Transaction," holding transaction details. 
To get started, clone the repository, implement the classes in your chosen language, and run the program to interact with the simulated ATM system. 
Contributions are encouraged via pull requests, and the project is licensed under the MIT License. 
Enjoy exploring the world of OOP through this ATM System example!
